This repo contains materials related to a community ecology course I'm teaching. The course is based on Mittlebach and McGill's Community Ecology textbook (second edition), and so the organization and topics covered are largely taken from that source. Any content here (aside from images that may be license otherwise) should be considered CC-BY, while code is licensed under an MIT license.
